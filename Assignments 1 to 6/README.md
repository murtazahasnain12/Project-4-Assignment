### [01_Mad_Libs](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v5JF892a6MZNWJ3TdGSEkKhHX-8afuWA) 
ðŸ‘‰ This code creates a **Mad Libs** game where the user inputs words (an adjective, two verbs, and a famous person's name). These words are inserted into a predefined sentence using an f-string, and the final sentence is printed. ðŸš€

### [02_Guess_The_Number_Game(Computer)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uIRNvh6aawDEHIrlnPVqryv_ynx0zahJ)
ðŸ‘‰ This code allows the computer to guess a number the user is thinking of within a given range. The user provides feedback (`[H]` for too high, `[L]` for too low, `[C]` for correct), and the computer adjusts its guesses accordingly until it finds the correct number.
### [03_Guess_The_Number_Game(User)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NbBZ9nY4nQoanAMl9Tw42dfGIZTvMnPb)
ðŸ‘‰ This Python script is a number guessing game. It generates a random number between 1 and `[x]`, then repeatedly asks the user to guess the number, providing feedback if the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.
