### [01_Mad_Libs](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v5JF892a6MZNWJ3TdGSEkKhHX-8afuWA) 
ðŸ‘‰ This code creates a **Mad Libs** game where the user inputs words (an adjective, two verbs, and a famous person's name). These words are inserted into a predefined sentence using an f-string, and the final sentence is printed. ðŸš€

### [02_Guess_The_Number_Game(Computer)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uIRNvh6aawDEHIrlnPVqryv_ynx0zahJ)
ðŸ‘‰ This code allows the computer to guess a number the user is thinking of within a given range. The user provides feedback (`[H]` for too high, `[L]` for too low, `[C]` for correct), and the computer adjusts its guesses accordingly until it finds the correct number.
### [03_Guess_The_Number_Game(User)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NbBZ9nY4nQoanAMl9Tw42dfGIZTvMnPb)
ðŸ‘‰ This Python script is a number guessing game. It generates a random number between 1 and `[x]`, then repeatedly asks the user to guess the number, providing feedback if the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.
### [04_Rock, paper, scissors](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_5YOltoiafxWREkeH9yifyxhhNDL63Ec)
ðŸ‘‰  This code implements a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game where:  
1. The user inputs their choice ('r' for rock, 'p' for paper, 's' for scissors).  
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.  
3. The program determines the winner based on the game rules.  
4. It prints whether the user **won, lost, or tied**.

### [05_Hangman_Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lLGYcLV6StdwwZ2Zx34E3GCBK7SbrVJ8#scrollTo=7f2jrjcVHckp)
ðŸ‘‰  This code implements a **Hangman game** where the player guesses letters to figure out a hidden word. Here's a short breakdown:

1. **Word Selection**: A random word is picked from a predefined list (`words`).
2. **Initial Setup**: The word is displayed as underscores (`_`) representing unguessed letters. The player has 6 attempts to guess letters.
3. **Game Loop**: 
   - The player guesses one letter at a time.
   - If the letter is correct, it is revealed in the word; if incorrect, the attempt count decreases.
   - The game continues until the word is fully guessed or attempts run out.
4. **Input Validation**: Ensures only single alphabetic characters are entered, and prevents repeated guesses.
5. **End of Game**: Displays a success or failure message depending on whether the word was guessed correctly within the allowed attempts.
